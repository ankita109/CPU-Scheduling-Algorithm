        <h1 class="ab">CPU SCHEDULING </h1>
        <p style="text-align:center; font-size: 1.3rem;"><b>CPU Scheduling</b> is the process of deciding which
            process will own the CPU to use while another process is suspended.<br>
            The main function of the CPU scheduling is to ensure that whenever the CPU remains idle, the OS has at least
            selected <br>
            one of the processes available in the ready-to-use line.<br></p>

    <h2 class="type">TYPES OF CPU SCHEDULING</h2>
    <p style="font-size:1.3rem;"><b>-> </b>There are two types of CPU scheduling :- <b> Preemptive</b>, and
        <b>Non-preemptive</b>.
    </p>

    <h3 class="prem">1. Preemptive Scheduling:-</h3>
    <p style="text-align:left; font-size: 1.0rem;margin-left:0.7rem;">Preemptive scheduling is used when a process
        switches from running state to ready state or from the waiting state to the ready state.</p>
    <img src="pre.png" class="pic" width="300rem" height="auto">

    <h3 class="prem">2. Non-Preemptive Scheduling:-</h3>
    <p style="text-align:left; font-size: 1.0rem;margin-left:0.7rem;">Non-Preemptive scheduling is used when a process
        terminates , or when a process switches from running state to waiting state.</p>

    <h2 class="type">CPU SCHEDULING TERMINOLOGIES</h2>
    <p class="term">1. <b>Arrival time</b>:- Arrival time (AT) is the time at which a process arrives at the ready
        queue.</p>
    <p class="term">2. <b>Burst Time</b>:- Burst time (BT) is the time required by the CPU to complete the execution of
        a process, or the amount of time required for the execution of a process. It is also sometimes called the
        execution time or running time.</p>
    <p class="term">3. <b>Completion Time</b>:- Also written as CT, Completion time is the time at which a process
        completes its execution. It is not to be confused with burst time.</p>
    <p class="term">4. <b>Turn-Around Time</b>:- Also written as TAT, Turn around time is simply the difference between
        completion time and arrival time <b>(CT - AT)</b> .</p>
    <p class="term">5. <b>Waiting Time</b>:- Waiting time (WT) of a process is the difference between turn around time
        and burst time<b>(TAT - BT)</b> , i.e. the amount of time a process waits for getting CPU resources in the ready
        queue.</p>
    <p class="term">6. <b>Response Time</b>:- Response time (RT) of a process is the time after which any process gets
        CPU resources allocated after entering the ready queue.</p>

    <h2 class="type">CPU SCHEDULING ALGORITHMS</h2>
    <div class="cpu">
        <div class="algo">
            <h3 style="color:rgb(4, 158, 119);text-decoration: underline;">SHORTEST JOB FIRST(SJF)</h3>
            <p style=" font-size: 1.0rem;">Shortest job first (SJF) is a scheduling process
                that selects the waiting process with the smallest execution time
                to execute next. This scheduling method may or may not be preemptive. Significantly reduces the average
                waiting
                time for other processes waiting to be executed.The full form of SJF is Shortest Job First.</p>
        </div><br>
        <div class="algo">
            <h3 style="color:rgb(4, 158, 119);text-decoration: underline;"> SHORTEST REMAINING TIME FIRST(STRF)</h3>
            <p style="font-size: 1.0rem;">Shortest remaining time first is the preemptive
                version of the Shortest job first which we have discussed earlier
                where the processor is allocated to the job closest to completion.In SRTF the process with the smallest
                amount of time remaining until completion is selected to execute.
            </p>
        </div><br>
        <div class="algo">
            <h3 style="color:rgb(4, 158, 119);text-decoration: underline;">ROUND ROBIN(RR)</h3>
            <p style="font-size: 1.0rem;">Round Robin is a CPU scheduling algorithm where
                each process is cyclically assigned a fixed time slot.
                It is the preemptive version of First come First Serve CPU Scheduling algorithm.
                Round Robin CPU Algorithm generally focuses on Time Sharing technique. </p>
